Datasets from 2008 to 2023 web scrapped. Preprocessing was done. Datasets collected were standardized to one single format. 

One hot encoding was done to all string type columns. Multiple Machine Learning Models such as Decision Trees , RandomForest ,
Neural Networks were used on the dataset. 

The best accuracy of the test data being - 62%
